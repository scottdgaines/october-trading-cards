# October Trading Cards

## Overview
A crisp frost steels the air in your lungs. In the distance, a mist emerges from the woods, lit only by the last umber rays of the setting sun. A church bell tolls in the distance as the ravens being their nightly hymn. October is upon us, and you have a mission to accomplish.

As fortold by the wandering mediums of old, October brings a magic all it's own. Daily, you must work towards accomplishing the set tasks of collecting the cards to complete the month's spell.
